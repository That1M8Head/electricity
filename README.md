# Electricity

An Electron Markdown editor for the supreme electrician

## About

### What?

Electricity is a Markdown editor written in Electron.

It's not the best editor in the world, but it sure is one of the editors ever
written.

### Why Electron?

Because I felt like it, shut up.

Plus, this is one instance where a web app actually makes sense, because it
renders to HTML.

And being a web app, it runs anywhere that has a web browser.

### 'Supreme electrician'?

Because it uses Electron. Get it?

It's not *actually* for electricians. If you are an electrician, you probably
don't use Markdown.
